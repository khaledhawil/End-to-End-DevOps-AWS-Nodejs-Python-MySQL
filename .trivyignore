# Trivy Ignore File
# Suppress false positives and low-risk vulnerabilities

# ============================================
# Alpine Base Image - Low Risk CVEs
# ============================================
# These are in base system packages that we don't directly use
# and would require local access or specific conditions to exploit

# busybox - requires local shell access (we run as non-root)
CVE-2023-42363
CVE-2023-42364
CVE-2023-42365

# musl libc - most require specific memory corruption scenarios
CVE-2023-4807

# ssl_client - not used in our services
CVE-2023-42366

# ============================================
# Node.js Dependencies - Development Only
# ============================================
# These are in devDependencies and not in production images
# (if using --omit=dev in production)

# ============================================
# Python Dependencies - Not Exploitable
# ============================================
# Vulnerabilities that require specific conditions we don't meet

# ============================================
# Nginx - Low Priority
# ============================================
# Nginx CVEs that don't apply to our configuration

# ============================================
# Why This Approach?
# ============================================
# 1. Focus on vulnerabilities we can actually fix
# 2. Don't waste time on false positives
# 3. Monitor critical/high that affect our attack surface
# 4. Update this file as new CVEs are analyzed
#
# IMPORTANT: Review this file quarterly and remove entries
# as patches become available in base images
